Once he saw how much of an impact this had on the oil production here, the technique continued to advance!">

The biggest change this year was that instead of using gelled gasoline such as napalm, we switched to water and gelling agents instead.">

This was also the time when we saw the first hydraulic fracking of shale formations specifically. This told us that fracking definitely wasn't going anywhere.

George Mitchell, your grandfather, was in fact the one who started this huge step of doing hydraulic fracturing on shales on a scale we've never seen. There were even more onshore wells because of this.">

By having this, we were able to detect exactly where the rock broke during this process and more effectively extract from there. Further experimentation was done by the Department of Energy at this time.">
