The biggest change this year was that instead of using gelled gasoline such as napalm, we switched to water and gelling agents instead.">

This was also the time when we saw the first hydraulic fracking of shale formations specifically. This told us that fracking definitely wasn't going anywhere.

By having this, we were able to detect exactly where the rock broke during this process and more effectively extract from there. Further experimentation was done by the Department of Energy at this time.">
